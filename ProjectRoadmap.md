# Stories on Demand

## Description
This program will enable one to create their own unique story based on inputs made. As the user decides which types of inputs they'd like to select it will gather them all together. Inputs will be categorized based on noun, verb, adjective, etc. They will also be more specific at times to make the story less generic, such as movie name, building, type of dog, etc.

## Roadmap
- [x] Review Story Generator with Python code to see if it works and how it works
- [x] Locate a tutorial that demonstrates user input generated stories
- [x] Identify the differences in the code to gain a better understanding of how you can merge them to accomplish your goal 
- [x] Attempt to merge sections of each code example and report any issues
- [x] Map out sections of story for the overall narrative that won't require user input
- [x] Select sections of the story that will require user input
- [x] Find another example of code that merges both sections to identify potential errors
- [x] Code sections and report any errors
- [ ] Test out random inputs to ensure the generator is working  
- [ ] Upload & Save
